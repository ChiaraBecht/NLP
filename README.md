# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository contains various NLP tools and solutions to tasks that helped me to understand NLP and to conduct the tasks my master thesis posed. During my journey I have worked with the NLP libraries SpaCy (using biomedical models provided by SciSpaCy), textblob and flair. Important tasks for my master thesis have been Named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging, depencency (DEP) tagging (using SpaCy), sentiment analysis (textblob and own rule set), certainty classification (flair).

In the folder SpaCy, textblob and flair i provide scripts to conduct these tasks. The folder Interactive_NLP provides a Graphical User Interface to explore the foundations of NLP.
