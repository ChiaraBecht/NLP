# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The field of NLP is a hot topic that draws attention from various people from very different backgrounds. Grasping main ideas is possible for basically anyone but the more details are added in the more complex and difficult to understand it becomes. Linguistics, but especially software engineering (to understand data and model structures), and deep learning (to understand model architectures) skills are required to get the full picture. I am myself have a background in biomedical sciences and data science. I have started to explore NLP for my master thesis and will share some my progress on understanding NLP at the surface, using NLP models and digging a bit deeper to be able to customize models with this repository. The techniques I have used for my masterthesis are currently under embargo and i will cover them only briefly.

This repository contains various NLP tools and solutions to tasks that helped me to understand NLP and to conduct the tasks my master thesis posed. During my journey I have worked with the NLP libraries SpaCy (using biomedical models provided by SciSpaCy), textblob and flair. Important tasks for my master thesis have been Named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging, depencency (DEP) tagging (using SpaCy), sentiment analysis (textblob and own rule set), certainty classification (flair).

In the folder SpaCy, textblob and flair i provide scripts to conduct these tasks. The folder Interactive_NLP provides a Graphical User Interface to explore the foundations of NLP.
